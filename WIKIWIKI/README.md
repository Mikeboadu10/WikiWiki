# WikiWiki
You are to design a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia. Your page should have an entry page, an index page, a search button, a new page, an edit page, a random page, and a markdown to HTML conversion.



### Setup
Make sure you have [Python3](https://https://www.python.org/) Installed on your system. \
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) framework
and [Markdown2](https://pypi.org/project/markdown2/) library can be installed using this command: 

     pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running
     python manage.py runserver

___

### Markdown to HTML Conversion:
On each entryâ€™s page, any Markdown content in the entry file should be converted to HTML before being displayed to the user. You may use the python-markdown2 package to perform this conversion, installable via pip3 install markdown2.
